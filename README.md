# CharaChorder Prefix List
Quick points:
- This repository keeps a list of prefixes and suffixes (infixes to come) and show which words can be chorded based on 
  these "fixs".
- This is in anticipation of the new firmware release from [CharaChorder](https://www.charachorder.com/) (date unannounced) 
  that allows for emitting a chorded output with no space following the chord.
- I envision that by chording via prefixes, infixes, and suffixes, one can reduce, by a significant amount, the number of 
  chords one has to memorize to grasp the skill of chording in the English language for most of their typing.
## Credit
Some modification of prefix and suffix list from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/kevinflo/5cfe332a7eb2239a6da6).

Java 2 Kotlin conversion from this [code](https://github.com/javiermartinezruiz/SearchPrefixInDictionary/blob/master/src/com/company/Main.java) 
to find words that match a prefix (to show usefulness of chording in "fixs").
## Future work 
Just a loose idea here. More prefixes, infixes, and suffixes should be added to completely grasp the English language.

Additionally, the same should be done for other languages if speakers of those languages so wish.

The `pom.xml` is cluttered as I copied from another project.
